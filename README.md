## Notes

Because I'm not new in the programming, it isn't quite hard for me to understand the Swift languange. The problems that I encountered during making this program is sometimes it's hard for me to find the error while making this app. Also, sometimes it is making me confuse for looking the correct function that I should use in the Swift.
